        <h4> The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call is a South Korean medical drama that follows Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk, an experienced trauma surgeon with a global background, including working in conflict zones. The series begins when Dr. Baek is recruited to join the struggling trauma team at Hankuk University Hospital, a medical institution in Seoul. His goal is to transform the trauma department into a leading center of excellence for saving lives in critical situations.<br><br>

            Despite his impressive skills, Dr. Baek’s unconventional approach to medicine and his brash personality create tension among his new colleagues, especially with the existing hospital staff who have a more traditional, careful approach. Throughout the series, Dr. Baek’s methods, combined with his confidence and experience, help the team save lives under pressure, earning the respect of his fellow doctors.<br><br>
            
            The series focuses on the challenges faced by trauma surgeons and the emotional and physical toll of working in a high-stakes environment. As Dr. Baek leads the team through intense trauma cases, the show delves into themes of teamwork, dedication, and the human side of medicine, with emotional and dramatic moments that highlight the pressures of the healthcare profession.<br><br>
            
            Overall, The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call is a fast-paced, character-driven medical drama that emphasizes both the technical and emotional aspects of saving lives in emergency situations.</h4>
